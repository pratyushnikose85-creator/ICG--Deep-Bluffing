CRITICAL entry point for the tournament arena.

Strategy archetype chosen: Monte-Carlo Expected-Value (EV) heuristics.

High-level idea
================
At every decision point we don't know the opponent's hole cards (the
"Imperfect Information" of the assignment). We approximate our winning
probability ("equity") against a *uniformly random* opponent hand by
running Monte Carlo rollouts (see equity_calculator.py): sample an
opponent hand + the remaining community cards many times, score both
hands with our from-scratch hand_evaluator.py, and average
win/tie/loss into a single equity number in [0, 1].

Given that equity estimate, the decision reduces to comparing it
against the pot odds required to profitably call, per the classic
Expected Value inequality:

    EV(call) = equity * (pot_size + amount_to_call)
               - (1 - equity) * amount_to_call

    Calling is +EV whenever:
        equity > amount_to_call / (pot_size + amount_to_call)   [pot odds]

We layer three decision bands on top of that baseline pot-odds rule:
  1. equity >= RAISE_THRESHOLD              -> RAISE  (value / build the pot)
  2. pot_odds + SAFETY_MARGIN < equity       -> CALL   (profitable but not
                                                          strong enough to raise)
  3. otherwise                               -> FOLD   (unless a cheap/free
                                                          semi-bluff raise or
                                                          free check applies)

A small semi-bluff frequency is mixed in on drawing hands so the bot
is not purely "bet only the nuts, fold everything else" (which would
be trivially exploitable) -- see BLUFF_* constants below.
