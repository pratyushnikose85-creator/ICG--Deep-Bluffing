-------
A from-scratch, self-contained Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) engine.
Not required by the arena (which supplies its own), but built to:
  (a) prove the OOP/engine fundamentals required by the assignment, and
  (b) let us locally simulate thousands of hands to sanity-check and
      tune CustomPokerBot before submission.

Implements exactly the rules from the spec:
  - 100-chip stack reset every hand (episodic, no carry-over)
  - Blinds: SB = 1, BB = 2
  - Fixed-limit betting: pre-flop/flop = 2-chip increments,
    turn/river = 4-chip increments
  - 4-bet cap per street (1 bet + 3 raises)
  - Heads-up turn order: SB acts first pre-flop, BB acts first post-flop
  - Showdown with best-of-7 hand evaluation and 50/50 split-pot ties
