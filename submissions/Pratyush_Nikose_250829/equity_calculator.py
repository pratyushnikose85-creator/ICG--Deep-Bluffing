equity_calculator.py
--------------------
Estimates hero's win probability ("equity") against a uniformly random
opponent hand, by Monte Carlo rollout: repeatedly sample an opponent
hole-card pair and the remaining un-dealt community cards from the
cards that are not yet visible, then score the resulting 7-card hands
with hand_evaluator.compare_hands.

This is the "Game Theory Context" building block referenced in the
assignment (Monte Carlo Simulations for hand-strength estimation),
and is the sole source of "hidden state" information the agent uses
in place of knowing the opponent's hole cards.
